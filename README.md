# Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project focuses on predicting salary using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm.  
It demonstrates how a distance-based regression model can be applied to real-world salary estimation problems.

## Project Description

Salary estimation is a common regression problem in machine learning.  
In this project, the KNN algorithm predicts salary by measuring similarity between data points.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow:
- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training
- Prediction and evaluation
